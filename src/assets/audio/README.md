# Audio Directory

For future implementation of sound effects and music:

- Retro chiptune music tracks
- UI sound effects (button clicks, alerts)
- Game feedback sounds (correct/incorrect actions)
- Ambient cyberpunk soundscapes

## Audio Guidelines

- Use compressed formats (MP3, OGG)
- Keep file sizes small for web performance
- Maintain consistent volume levels
- Follow retro/cyberpunk aesthetic
